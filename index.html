    <pre>
    body {
      background-color: lightblue;
      font-size: 150%;
    }
    </pre>
    <p>Save the file and refresh this page.  Whoa! The white background should now be a nice color and all our text is bigger!</p>
    <hr>
  </div>

  <h3>Curious! Everything got bigger!</h3>
  <p>Feel free to set font-sizes back to normal. We set a font-size using the body tag, but did you notice that EVERYTHING got bigger? All the text on this page is inside 'p' and 'div' tags.</p>
  <p>Because the 'body' tag contains all the 'p' tags and all the 'div' tags, some values we set, like font-size, will trickle down to the elements inside</p>
  <hr>
  <h3>What are classes and ids?</h3>
  <p id="about-classes-and-ids">Selecting by tag like we just did works well when we are making changes to every instance of a tag (all 'h1', all 'p' tags, etc..).</p>
  <p>Sometimes, we want only <em>some</em> 'p' tags to look a certain way, or even one specific tag. In order to change specific elements, we use CSS classes and ids.</p>
  <p>To implement a class, we will need to write a CSS block just like we did with 'body'.  For example:
  <pre>
    .myClass {
      background-color: gray;
      color: blue
    }
  </pre>
  <p>To write declarations for a class, first decide on a name. Writing '.', then the name will let CSS know these are class declarations</p>
  <p>To use this class, we just put it inside any HTML element we want, like so:</p>
  <pre>
    <h3 class="myClass">Example Header</h3>
  </pre>
  Now, just this one 'h3' element will have a gray background and blue text! Not only that, <em>any</em> element that is given the class "myClass" will have a gray background and blue text.
  </p>
  <p>Let's practice this. First, create a class in 'style.css'.  It can be called anything you like. Your name, your favorite color, etc..</p>
  <p>Next, add some declarations. If you're not sure what to add, try some or all of the following, and feel free to change the values:</p>
  <pre>
    .anExampleClass {
      font-size: 300%;
      background-color: lightgreen;
      font-family: courier;
      border: 1px dotted red;
      text-transform: uppercase;
      letter-spacing: 5px;
      transition: rotate(-30)deg;
    }
  </pre>
  <p>Finally, with our class declarations created, we need to assign this class to elements in index.html</p>
  <p>Open index.html in your IDE, choose some HTML elements and add 'class=' followed by the name of your new class, in quotes. Maybe try adding a class to the `h1` and `h2` elements at the top of the page.</p>
  <p>Save the work you've done, and refresh this page.  The elements you've selected should display the styling you've declared.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Using an id for styling works the same way, with only two main differences. Instead of '.' at the start of the class name in our CSS file, we use '#'. Also, when assigning to an HTML eleemnt, instead of typing 'class="myClass"', you would write:</p>
  <pre>
    <h1 id="myHeaderId">Header!</h1>
  </pre>
</body>
</html>
